# Secure DMZ Architecture in AWS with AWS WAF

This project demonstrates a secure, scalable DMZ design implemented in AWS, featuring:

- **VPC with Public and Private Subnets:** Public subnet hosts internet-facing resources (ALB, Bastion Host, Web Servers). Private subnet houses application and database servers isolated from direct internet access.
- **Internet Gateway (IGW):** Enables inbound/outbound internet connectivity for public subnet.
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB):** Distributes incoming traffic across web servers, improving availability and fault tolerance.
- **AWS WAF Integration:** Provides protection against common web exploits by filtering malicious requests before they reach the ALB.
- **Bastion Host:** Secure jump server for administrative access to private instances.
- **NAT Gateway:** Allows private instances to access the internet securely for updates and patches.
- **Security Groups and Network ACLs:** Stateful and stateless firewalls enforcing strict traffic control.

# Secure DMZ Architecture in AWS with AWS WAF

This repository contains a design and implementation example of a secure DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) architecture on AWS, incorporating AWS WAF to protect public-facing web applications.

---

## Overview

A secure DMZ provides an additional layer of security by isolating internet-facing services from internal backend resources. This project demonstrates a best-practice AWS network design to:

- Separate public and private subnets within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
- Use an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute incoming traffic.
- Protect the ALB with AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) against common web attacks.
- Enable secure administrative access through a Bastion Host.
- Use NAT Gateway for outbound internet access from private resources.
- Enforce strict network traffic filtering via Security Groups and Network ACLs.

## Architecture Components

| Component          | Description                                                                                  |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **VPC**            | Virtual Private Cloud isolating the environment with CIDR 10.0.0.0/16                        |
| **Public Subnet**   | Hosts ALB, Bastion Host, and Web Servers; connected to Internet Gateway                      |
| **Private Subnet**  | Contains Application Servers and Database (RDS); no direct internet access                   |
| **Internet Gateway**| Enables inbound/outbound internet traffic for public subnet                                 |
| **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** | Distributes incoming traffic to Web Servers                             |
| **AWS WAF**         | Web Application Firewall filtering malicious traffic before ALB                             |
| **Bastion Host**    | Secure jump server for admin access to private subnet resources                              |
| **NAT Gateway**     | Allows private subnet instances to initiate outbound internet connections                    |
| **Security Groups** | Stateful firewalls controlling inbound/outbound traffic at instance level                   |
| **Network ACLs**    | Stateless subnet-level traffic filtering                                                    |

## Traffic Flow

1. Incoming traffic from the Internet passes through the Internet Gateway.
2. Traffic is inspected and filtered by AWS WAF.
3. Allowed requests reach the Application Load Balancer.
4. ALB forwards requests to Web Servers in the public subnet.
5. Web Servers communicate securely with backend Application Servers and Database in private subnet.
6. Admin users connect via Bastion Host to securely access private subnet instances.
7. Private subnet instances use NAT Gateway for internet-bound traffic such as software updates.
